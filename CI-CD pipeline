To integrate the Spring Boot Employee Management System (EMS) service into a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, the process begins by creating a pipeline job in Jenkins and connecting it with the project's GitHub repository. Whenever developers push code changes to GitHub, a webhook triggers Jenkins to start the pipeline automatically. The pipeline typically includes multiple stages like Checkout, Build, Test, Package, and Deploy. In the Checkout stage, Jenkins pulls the latest code from GitHub. In the Build stage, Maven is used to compile the project, followed by the Test stage, where unit and integration tests are executed. Once tests pass, the Package stage creates a deployable .jar file. Finally, in the Deploy stage, Jenkins uses SSH and SCP commands to transfer the packaged application to a remote server, stops any existing running instance, and starts the new version of the application. This automated CI/CD process ensures that code changes are quickly built, tested, and deployed without manual intervention, improving development speed, code quality, and deployment efficiency.
