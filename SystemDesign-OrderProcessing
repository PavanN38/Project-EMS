To design a system for Order Processing we basically follow the following steps:

[User] 
   |
[API Gateway] 
   |
-------------------------------
| Order Service        |
| Payment Service      |
| Inventory Service    |
| Shipping Service     |
| Notification Service |
| User Service         |
-------------------------------
   |
Kafka Messaging Queue
   |
Databases (SQL/NoSQL)
   |
Docker → Kubernetes → Load Balancer
   |
Monitoring & Alerts (Prometheus + Grafana + ELK)


Microservices and Their Responsibilities:
=========================================
Order Service-	Handle order creation, updates, status tracking, and maintain order history.
Payment Service-	Handle payment processing, integration with third-party payment gateways, and manage transaction status.
Inventory Service-	Manage product availability, stock updates, and reservation of inventory during order placement.
Shipping Service-	Handle shipment creation, tracking, integration with shipping partners, and update shipment status.
Notification Service-	Send real-time notifications (email, SMS, push) to users about order updates and payment status.
User Service- Handle user registration, authentication, authorization, and user profile management.

Some of the common things we need to take care while designing such systems are:
1.  Communication Patterns(Synchronous/ ASynchronous )
2. Data Storage
3.  Scalability & High Availability (Docker, Kubernates and AWS)
4.  Monitoring & Observability (ELK)
5.  Security
6. CI/CD Pipeline

By following these we can build a system which can be production ready and secured.
